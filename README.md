# AI Therapist

AI Therapist is a web-based application designed to provide mental health support using artificial intelligence. It allows users to interact with an AI agent trained to offer a therapeutic conversation experience.

It integrates with the Google Gemini API to process and respond to user input intelligently, emulating a compassionate and engaging conversational experience.
